# Basic-Portfolio

Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio. It is less an expression of my abilities in coding (it's written in HTML5/CSS), and more a presentation of who I am and the work that I've done thus far. It is my hope that you come away with a sense of my passion and dedication to this field. There is a lot that I really like about the overall design of this portfolio and its straightforward interface. However, I also know that it will eventually need to be re-done in order to show my current skills.

The most important information in this portfolio is on the Portfolio page. There you will find the projects that I've worked on and hopefully gain a sense of who I am as a programmer. The two group projects, Delta 32 and Nomad Nation, are among my favorites overall. These two highlight many of my front and back end skills and also my ability to work in a group, utilize git hub, and complete projects on a deadline.

    On Delta 32, I worked almost on much of the back-end. We used Sequelize to establish a MySQL database and routed using Express. I was in charge of creating the models for the database, establishing the schema, and ensuring it was configued properly. I also helped in creating the MVC for the project and was later in charge of deployment to Heroku.

    On Nomad Nation, I worked on both the front and the back end. I was in charge of two of the APIs including the AJAX and eventually the JQuery/Javascript. I also worked through numerous small bugs/issues to ensure a "complete" project. Lastly, I was in charge of the presentation for the project and helped engage the audience using Prezi, audience interaction, and demos.

The second most important page is the About page. Although it is short, I hope that you get sense of why I love coding and how I came to find it as a passion.

Lastly, the Contact page will help us connect so we can chat more.

Thank you again for your time and I hope we can talk soon!
